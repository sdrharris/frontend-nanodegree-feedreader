## Project Completed By

1. Taking the JavaScript testing course
2. Reviewing the functionality of the application in my browser.
3. Reviewing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jasmine spec files.
4. Editing the allFeeds file to fail and returning the allFeeds file to its prior state.
5. Writing a test to loop through each feed in the allFeeds object to ensure the URL and name is defined and not empty.
6. Writing new test suites named "The menu", "Initial Entries", and "New Feed Selection".
7. Writing test to ensure "The menu, is hidden by default"; the "Initial Entries, loadFeed function is called, completes it work, and that there is at least a single elemnt within the .feed container"; and ensuring that when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
8. Ensuring that each test is independent of the other; that feeds are loaded before they are tested; and implementing error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
